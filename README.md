# android navigation drawer demo

Small demo application to get a working navigation drawer to change activities. Google's iosched application has been used a reference. Structure taken from Android Studio blueprints (navdrawer activity).

Not everything is working so far, for example the active element is just set the second time you click, but it works quite well for an experiment.
